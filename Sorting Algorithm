Write a program to sort given 10 numbers from memory location 2100H to 2109H in the ascending order.
MVI B, 09H           ; B is for outer loop 

    START:  LXI HL, 2100H  

 	 	MVI C, 09H           ; C is for inner lop 

    BACK:    MOV A, M  

 	 	INX HL           

 	 	CMP M           

 	 	JC SKIP        ; Jump if carry 

 	 	JZ SKIP        ; iff the present zero flag value is 1 

 	 	MOV D, M 

 	 	MOV M, A 

 	 	DCX HL      ; It decreases the memory location pointed by HL pair by 1. 

 	 	MOV M, D 

 	 	INX HL           

    SKIP:     DCR C      

 	 	JNZ BACK 

 	 	DCR B           

 	 	JNZ START 

 	 	HLTï¿¼Enter
